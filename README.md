This project was made as my Masther thesis in 2020. 

The goal of this project was to use machine learning methods to train an antonomous cars to drive on a city-like road network consisting of curved roads and crossroads. Cars are capable of following externally generated path, avoid collisions and - to some extend - park in designated parking spaces. Videos with trained behaviours can be seen [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ003KpHcv4&feature=youtu.be) and [here](https://youtu.be/Ex5pPEGExJE).

Project was made in [Unity](https://unity.com/) using [ML-Agents toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

Code can be found in Assets/Global/Scripts.
